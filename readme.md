# Dashboard for WinForms - How to Display Products with Sales Greater than Average Sales per Category

The example shows how to filter item source data by the aggregated *ProductSales* field and how to display only total sales by products that are greater than the average sales of the entire category.

## Example Structure

The *SalesByProduct* calculated field uses the following function to obtain the total sales by product:

```
aggr(Sum([ProductSales]), [ProductName])
```

The following function determines average product sales per category (the *SalesByProductAverage* calculated field):

```
aggr(Avg([SalesByProduct]), [CategoryName])
```

The created fields are added to the Gridâ€™s hidden dimension section and and the ```[SalesByProduct] > [SalesByProductAverageInCategory]``` expression is set in a [dashboard item filter](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/116537/common-features/data-shaping/filtering) to see totals only for those products whose sales are greater than the average in the corresponding category.
